__Creating a Custom Application with DATACAKE API__  
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a custom application using the DATACAKE API. You’ll learn how to connect to the GraphQL API, which is specifically designed for monitoring your devices and tracking their temperatures.
__Setting Up and Deploying the Test App:__  

__Step 1:__ Visit [__repository__](https://github.com/datacake/datacake-next13-apollo-app) - https://github.com/datacake/datacake-next13-apollo-app. Click the __green “Code”__ button located in the top right corner and select __“Download ZIP”__ from the dropdown menu.  

__Step 2:__ Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract its contents. Open the extracted folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code). If using Visual Studio Code, navigate to __File > Open > Folder__ and select the extracted folder.  

__Step 3:__ Launch the terminal in your code editor (Ctrl/Command + ` for Visual Studio Code).  

__Step 4:__ Ensure your terminal’s working directory is set to \datacake-next13-apollo-app-main.  

__Step 5:__ In the terminal, enter npm run dev. Once the app starts, you’ll see a link highlighted in red. You can click on or copy this link to view the app in your browser.  

__Step 6:__ By default, the app should be accessible at __http://localhost:3000__. If you encounter any issues, refer to the terminal messages after executing npm run dev. Look for a line starting with __“ready... url: http://localhost:...”__ to identify the correct port.  

__Step 7:__ Enjoy your custom application!
